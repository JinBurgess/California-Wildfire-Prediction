1. The average temperature over the past 15 days has been relatively high at 27.4°C, and the current temperature is 29.7°C. Higher temperatures can increase the likelihood of wildfires by drying out vegetation.
2. The average wind speed over the past 15 days has been 23.8kph, and the current wind speed is 29.2kph. Strong winds can help spread wildfires quickly, making them more difficult to contain.
3. The average dew point over the past 15 days has been low at 9.5%, and the current dew point is 10.8%. Low dew points indicate dry air, which can further contribute to fire risk as it dries out fuels.",1
